## Custom-Darts-Metric

### In this project, I wanted to take a pre existing metric that is often used in other sports and adapt it to darts, because there are relatively little advanced statistics surrounding the sport. That new metric was Expected Win Chance, and I used data from the 2025 World Darts Championship to develop it. This was done first by gathering historical statistics on the success rates of pro darts players on each potential checkout. After that, I was able to calculate how their chance of checking out on their next turn changed based on what they were aiming at during the current turn. In creating this new metric, another one came out naturally as well: what I called "Clutchness". Clutchess referred to the areas on the board that the players increased their win chance the most by aiming at. I concluded that these were the most reliable targets for each of the players on the night. More in depth explanations and summary of results are in the report tab.
